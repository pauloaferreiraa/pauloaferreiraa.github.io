description: Psychology importance as a software engineer

A software engineer is often perceived by the general public as someone who lives inside his/her mom's basement and sees no day light day in day out. Even though this is not entirely true there is some truth behind this thought, not the literal mean, but as an anti social "being".

When I look at my peers and even at myself it is possible to see a pattern. A person who follows the software development path is usually someone who uses a computer since a very young age and actually spends a lot of time using the machine. This makes us very profficient using a computer compared to the average Joe. However, there is a downside to it, of course, which is the lack of social interaction it causes. One could argue that many people who spend a lot of time in front of computer tends to play a lot of online games which require communication in order to achieve a goal. Thus, compensating that lack of social interaction. Although, communication through voice alone without even seeing other people's faces is not able to tackle all the missing parts that comes from an in person communication. There is much more to communication than just talking, humans use their body along with their voice to express an idea.

Apart from the social skills that do no develop properly when one isolates himself, there is also another key skill that does not evolve. Which is Emotional intelligence.
